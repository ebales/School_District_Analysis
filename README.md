# School_District_Analysis
Bootcamp Week 4

## Background

The purpose of this activity was to help Maria understand the performance of a school district and the schools within it based on the following factors:
	-Type of school
	-Size of school
	-Amount of funding
The performance of the schools was determined by analyzing the average math and reading scores of students.

The results of this analysis will be used to make decisions on how to fund and support schools in the following school year.

## Results

The key metrics for the district as a whole are displayed in the tables below.  In the process of conducting this analysis, we discovered the 9th grade class at Thomas High school had altered their scores.  To correct or the alteration, those scores were removed from the analysis.
The original district analysis was:

With the Thomas High School 9th graders removed, the data is adjusted to be:

An overview by individual school shows how performance varies between institutions:

It’s important to note that the data above contains a correction for Thomas High School which removed the data from the 9th grade class based on knowledge their scores had been unfairly modified. Prior to the correction, Thomas High School data was:
 
By making the correction, the following changes were observed:
	-The total number of students was reduced from 39,170 to 38,709
	-Total budget for the district remained the same
	-The average scores for math and reading remained the same for the district, which is expected since the total number of students removed from the population was relatively small.
	-The percent passing math and reading for the district also remained the same, again because the number of students removed made up a very small portion of the population. However, the removal made a significant difference in the values seen for Thomas High School specifically.
	-Overall percentage passing for the district didn’t have significant change, but overall percentage passing for Thomas High School increased significantly.

## Summary
Overall, the key factors that appear to have an impact on the overall performance of a school are the type of school and the size of the school with charter schools and smaller population schools having the highest overall passing percentages.
The top performing schools are:

The bottom performing schools are:

Removing the suspect grades from Thomas High School did not have an impact on the overall district performance, but it did adjust the performance of Thomas High School raising the school into the top 5 performing schools.
